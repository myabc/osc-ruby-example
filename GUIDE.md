## What you'll need

If you're using Ruby on your own machine - and not using Nitrous - then you need to check you have all of the following:

1. Recent **Ruby** installed: See [][INSTALL_RUBY.md]
3. A good text editor, e.g. [Atom](https://atom.io/).
2. Optionally, a **Git** implementation or client such as [GitHub for Desktop]()

## Install Sinatra

Sinatra is simple library that helps us build web applications.

1. In the **Terminal** (Terminal.app under *Applications/Utilities*) or **Command Prompt on Windows** (Command Prompt under *All Applications > Accessories > System Tools*), type or copy and paste the following without the comment:

  ```ruby
  gem install sinatra erubis
  gem install shotgun # on Mac/Linux only
  ```

  Wait for the installation to proceed.
